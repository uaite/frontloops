# Eduardo's frontloops
[Frontloops](https://frontloops.io/) challenges implemented in React with styled-components for practice.

For now, this repository contains the Markup challenges, so most of these components aren't actually functioning pieces. My objective is to practice markup but also get familiar with the React + styled-components way of doing things. Some things are also done in a way that isn't necessarily optimal. I took this as an opportunity to learn new or different ways of approaching problems. :)
