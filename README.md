# frontloops
Frontloops challenges implemented in React with styled-components for practice.

Right now, these are the Markup challenges. Elements challenges will follow and will be implemented with React + Redux and tested with Jest.

I might also include behavior in some of the markup challenges if I feel like they'd be a nice case. :)
